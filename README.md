## About me
I’m an American software developer based in London. I'm passionate about writing beautiful and well-tested code, building great products with great teams, and continuously learning and improving my skills as a developer.

## Skills
### Software craftsmanship
I'm a big fan of good engineering and adhering to industry best practice. I test-drive everything, think carefully about design patterns, and refactor constantly. Sandi Metz is always in the back of my mind, keeping my code simple, clean, and OO.
### Teamwork
Being part of a team is one of the most exciting parts of developing software. I'm happiest when I'm pair programming, doing standups, and staying late/ordering food with others to finish a release. I'm also a big communicator and enjoy giving and receiving feedback frequently.
### Curiosity
Developing software is enormously satisfying for my intellectual appetite. There is always something new to learn and no shortage of material to learn it. I've always got several tabs open in my browser with online coding tutorials, and meetups and conferences are my thing (and not just because of the free food).

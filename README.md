## About me
I'm an American developer based in London at the moment with a passion for writing clean, well-tested, object-oriented code. For the past two years, I've been working and building things for startups in San Francisco and Washington, DC, and at the beginning of the year I moved to London to formalize my otherwise self-taught coding education at Makers Academy.

At Makers, beyond building on my previous knowledge of core programming languages and frameworks, I also picked up some amazing software craftsmanship skills and am well-versed in TDD, BDD, OOP, XP, pair-programming, etc. I'm excited now to transfer these skills to a new team and build some great products with some great people.

## Skills
### Software craftsmanship
I'm a big fan of good engineering and adhering to industry best practice. I test-drive everything, think carefully about design patterns, and refactor constantly. Sandi Metz is always in the back of my mind, keeping my code simple, clean, and OO.
### Teamwork
Being part of a team is one of the most exciting parts of developing software. I'm happiest when I'm pair programming, doing standups, and staying late/ordering food with others to finish a release. I'm also a big communicator and enjoy giving and receiving feedback frequently.
### Speed
I know what it's like working in a fast-paced, fast-growth environment. I'm pragmatic, a prioritizer, and a master of keyboard shortcuts, so I can turn around and ship quality, working code on short deadlines.
### Curiosity
Developing software is really satisfying for my intellectual appetite. There is always something new to learn and no shortage of material to learn it. I've always got several tabs open in my browser with online coding tutorials, and meetups and conferences are my thing (and not just because of the free food).
